## Lesson_010 task
Write a class that performs a mathematical description of curvilinear trapezoids (information about a curvilinear trapezoid should include the left and right boundaries, as well as the equation of the bounding curve).\
Provide a method that calculates the area of a curvilinear trapezoid, as well as a method that plots the function f(x) in a given range x 𝜖 [a,b].\
Check the functionality of the code using the following data as an example:
| Left lim | Right lim | f(x) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1.2 | sin(x) + cos(2x) |
| 0.2 | 0.8 | x*tg(x) + 2 |
| 0 | 10 | x^3 − 10*𝑥^2 + 170 |

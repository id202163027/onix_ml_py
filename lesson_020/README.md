## Lesson_020 task
Using the MNIST dataset train autoencoder with different noise factor:
1. Set noise_factor to 0.1; 0.2; 0.3; 0.4; 0.5; 0.6. For each of these values, prepare a dataset and train the models.
2. Test all 6 models, compare the final values of the loss functions.
3. For any 10 selected images from the test sample, compare the quality of image filtering for each of the models. To do this, use the MSE (Mean Squared Error) indicator.
4. Build the dependence of MSE vs noise_factor.

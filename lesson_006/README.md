## Lesson_006 task
Create a notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, in which do the following:
1. Load data from the dataset.txt file.
2. Construct the following graphs based on the obtained data (on separate figures): linear, stepped, stem-plot, column diagram.
3. Find the maximum value among the provided data. Using the annotate function, mark the maximum value on the line graph.
4. Multiply each Y value by 2 and combine the line graphs Y1 = f(X) and Y2 = 2*f(X) on the same figure.
Note: the size of the background and the settings of the chart style should be chosen in such a way that the visualization is clear.

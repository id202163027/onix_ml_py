## Lesson_007 task
Create a class whose methods are:
1. Implement all standard fast unary mathematical operations
over the elements of the selected slice of a two-dimensional array, zeroing out all elements that are not related to the slice; slice must be specified as a list of integers; by default (if the slice is not specified) fast unary mathematical operations are performed on all elements of the array.
2. transform the original two-dimensional array into a three-dimensional one by copying the original two-dimensional array along the third axis (axis=2) a given number of times.
